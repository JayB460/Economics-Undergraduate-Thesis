# Economics-Undergraduate-Thesis
For my year-long Economics Undergrad thesis, a requirement to conduct data analysis was to learn a software program called Stata. Stata is a straigtforward statistical anaylis package that consists of its own, easy to learn language. While learning Stata, I conducted research on my undegraduate thesis which studied the effect of Federal Unemployment Insurance Extended Benefits on three labor market characteristicss; unemployment rate, employment rate, and labor force participation rate. In late June of 2021, 26 states opted out of the federal unemployment insurance program that provided extended benefits under the CARES act enacted on March 27th, 2020. Using monthly state employment status of the noninstitutional population provided by the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) and CDC vaccination rate data, I use a difference-in-difference design to compare states opting out versus states retaining UI until expiration in September 2021 in terms of unemployment, employment, and labor force participation rates. I control for pandemic impacts using Covid-19 specific deaths and cases. I find no statistically significant impact of opting out on state aggregate unemployment rates, labor force participation rates, and employment rates.
